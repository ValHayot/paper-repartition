abstract = "We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining all pairs shortest paths in directed graphs with real-valued edge weights. Given a dynamic directed graph G such that each edge can assume at most S different real values, we show how to support updates in O(n2.5Slog3n) amortized time and queries in optimal worst-case time. This algorithm is deterministic: no previous fully dynamic algorithm was known before for this problem. In the special case where edge weights can only be increased, we give a randomized algorithm with one-sided error that supports updates faster in O(S⋅nlog3n) amortized time. We also show how to obtain query/update trade-offs for this problem, by introducing two new families of randomized algorithms. Algorithms in the first family achieve an update bound of O˜(S⋅k⋅n2)1 and a query bound of O˜(n/k), and improve over the previous best known update bounds for k in the range (n/S)1/3⩽k<(n/S)1/2. Algorithms in the second family achieve an update bound of O˜(S⋅k⋅n2) and a query bound of O˜(n2/k2), and are competitive with the previous best known update bounds (first family included) for k in the range (n/S)1/6⩽k<(n/S)1/3."

	abstract = {Reference brains have become a standard tool in human brain research. Reference brains presently in the public domain provide a spatial framework at the macroscopic level. Amunts et al. (p. 1472) present a high-resolution (20 {\textmu}m) three-dimensional reconstruction of a human brain. The tool will be freely available to help with interpreting functional neuroimaging studies, fiber tract analyses, and assigning molecular and gene expression data. Reference brains are indispensable tools in human brain mapping, enabling integration of multimodal data into an anatomically realistic standard space. Available reference brains, however, are restricted to the macroscopic scale and do not provide information on the functionally important microscopic dimension. We created an ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional (3D) model of a human brain at nearly cellular resolution of 20 micrometers, based on the reconstruction of 7404 histological sections. {\textquotedblleft}BigBrain{\textquotedblright} is a free, publicly available tool that provides considerable neuroanatomical insight into the human brain, thereby allowing the extraction of microscopic data for modeling and simulation. BigBrain enables testing of hypotheses on optimal path lengths between interconnected cortical regions or on spatial organization of genetic patterning, redefining the traditional neuroanatomy maps such as those of Brodmann and von Economo.},
